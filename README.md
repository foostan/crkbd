# KBD - for building keyboard libraries

## KiCad Footprint Libraries

This repository contains the KiCad footprint libraries for building keyboard.

**The libraries in this repository are intended to be used with KiCad version 5 or with a nightly that supports rounded rectangle and polygon pads.**

Each footprint library is stored as a directory with the `.pretty` suffix. The footprint files are `.kicad_mod` files within 

## KiCad Symbols

This repository contains the KiCad schematic symbol libraries for building keyboard.

**The libraries in this repositiory are intended for KiCad version 5.x**

Each symbol library is stored as a `.lib` and `.dcm` file pair.

## KiCad 3D Models
This repository contains 3D models for rendering and MCAD integration, for use with [KiCad EDA](http://www.kicad.org/) software.
The model needs a mechanical model source (a manually-modelled or script-generated file); its WRL counterpart file must be obtained as a conversion from the MCAD model
